# Spooky Times

**Once upon a time**, in a *raining dark night*, a shadow was walking inside an old building.\
A lot of __weird noise__ was heard from there but not only!

Meanwhile in the *neighborhood*, a kid was looking through the window instead of sleeping and saw some activity inside the old **scary** building.
